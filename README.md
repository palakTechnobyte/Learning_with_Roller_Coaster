# **Roller Coaster Data Analysis ðŸŽ¢**

## OverviewðŸ‘€
This project focuses on exploring and analyzing roller coaster data using data science techniques. The dataset contains detailed information on roller coasters from around the world, including their speed, height, number of inversions, G-force, and more.

*The analysis aims to uncover interesting insights and trends, such as:*

- How speed and height relate to one another.
- The impact of design factors like G-force and vertical angles.
- Geographical distribution of roller coasters across different regions.
- This project uses Python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn to clean, process, and visualize the data.

### Key Featuresâœ¨
- **Data Cleaning:** Handle missing data, drop irrelevant columns, and format the dataset for easier analysis.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualize roller coaster features such as speed, height, inversions, and G-force.
- **Geographical Insights:** Map out the global locations of roller coasters using latitude and longitude data.
- **Statistical Analysis:** Generate summary statistics to understand key metrics like the average speed and height.

### Technologies UsedðŸš€
- Jupyter Notebook: For interactive data exploration.
- Pandas & NumPy: Data manipulation and processing.
- GitHub: For version control and project sharing.
  
### DatasetðŸ“ˆ
